## Concepts Covered
# Full Stack Web Development - MERN Stack

## Core Concepts

### Web Fundamentals
- **Web**: System of interconnected documents and resources accessible via the internet
- **Web Development**: Process of creating websites and web applications

### Websites vs Web Applications
- **Websites**: Static, read-only content with minimal user interaction (e.g., Wikipedia, blogs)
- **Web Applications**: Dynamic, interactive content that changes based on user actions (e.g., LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook)

### Web Application Architecture (3 Layers)
1. **Frontend (UI Layer)**: Visual interface users interact with (buttons, text, images, designs)
2. **Backend (Logic Layer)**: Handles application logic, functionality, and processing (authentication, business logic)
3. **Database Layer**: Stores and manages application data

### Full Stack Development
- **Full Stack Developer**: Engineer with knowledge across all three layers (frontend, backend, database)

### MERN Stack
- **M** - MongoDB (Database)
- **E** - Express.js (Backend)
- **R** - React.js (Frontend)
- **N** - Node.js (Backend)
